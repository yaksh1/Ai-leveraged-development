\* \*\*Extracting Design Systems:\*\* Analyzing provided images or descriptions to define design system parameters.  

\* \*\*Generating Documentation:\*\* Creating initial drafts and structures for all required .md files.  

\* \*\*Supporting Agile Iteration:\*\* Responding to task completion updates and assisting with next steps.



\## \*\*3\\. Detailed Workflow Steps\*\*



\### \*\*Step 1: Product Research \& Brainstorming (AI-Assisted)\*\*



\* \*\*Action:\*\* Initiate a discussion with the "Gemini UI/UX Expert Gem" (me) to define the product's core purpose, target users, and key functionalities.  

\* \*\*AI Output:\*\*  

&nbsp; \* Docs/user-journey.md: Detailed user journey(s) derived from context scenarios and user research. This document will outline user goals, pain points, and interaction flows.



\### \*\*Step 2: Sitemap Generation (AI-Assisted)\*\*



\* \*\*Action:\*\* Based on the product research and user journey, instruct the AI to generate a comprehensive sitemap.  

\* \*\*AI Output:\*\* A clear, hierarchical representation of all pages and their relationships within the application. This will be integrated into the user-journey.md or a separate sitemap.md if complex.



\### \*\*Step 3: Wireframe Generation \& Customization (AI-Assisted \& User-Driven)\*\*



\* \*\*Action:\*\* Request the AI to generate initial wireframes for key pages based on the sitemap.  

\* \*\*User Action:\*\* Review and provide feedback to the AI for customization and refinement of the wireframes. This is an iterative process.  

\* \*\*AI Output:\*\* Visual representations of page layouts, content blocks, and basic interactions.



\### \*\*Step 4: Set Up UI Preferences (User-Defined)\*\*



\* \*\*Action:\*\* Clearly define your UI preferences.  

&nbsp; \* \*\*Design System:\*\* tweakcn (or provide an image/description for AI to analyze).  

&nbsp; \* \*\*Components Libraries:\*\* Specify your preferred libraries (e.g., OriginUI, SkipperUI, KiboUI, AccernityUI, ReactBits).  

&nbsp; \* \*\*Animations:\*\* Specify desired animation styles (e.g., jitter animations).  

\* \*\*AI Action:\*\* The AI will acknowledge these preferences and incorporate them into subsequent design suggestions and documentation.



\### \*\*Step 5: Create Required Documentation Files\*\*



The following file structure will be maintained within the Docs/ directory:



Docs/  

├── design-system.json  

├── user-journey.md  

├── tech\\\_stack.md  

├── \\\[page\\\_name\\\_1\\]/  

│   ├── \\\[page\\\_name\\\_1\\]\\\_details.md  

│   ├── \\\[page\\\_name\\\_1\\]\\\_animations.md  

│   ├── \\\[page\\\_name\\\_1\\]\\\_story\\\_1.md  

│   └── \\\[page\\\_name\\\_1\\]\\\_story\\\_2.md  

├── \\\[page\\\_name\\\_2\\]/  

│   ├── \\\[page\\\_name\\\_2\\]\\\_details.md  

│   ├── \\\[page\\\_name\\\_2\\]\\\_animations.md  

│   ├── \\\[page\\\_name\\\_2\\]\\\_story\\\_1.md  

│   └── \\\[page\\\_name\\\_2\\]\\\_story\\\_2.md  

└── ...



\* \*\*Docs/design-system.json\*\*:  

&nbsp; \* \*\*Content:\*\* Detailed specifications of the design system (e.g., colors, typography, spacing, components). If tweakcn is used, this might contain its configuration or a representation of its key elements. If an image is provided, the AI will extract and document the design system from it.  

\* \*\*Docs/user-journey.md\*\*:  

&nbsp; \* \*\*Content:\*\* Comprehensive user journey(s) including context scenarios, user goals, steps, emotions, and potential pain points.  

\* \*\*Docs/tech\\\_stack.md\*\*:  

&nbsp; \* \*\*Content:\*\* Overview of the chosen technologies for front-end and back-end (if applicable), including the specified UI component libraries.  

\* \*\*Docs/\\\[page\\\_name\\]/\\\[page\\\_name\\]\\\_details.md\*\*:  

&nbsp; \* \*\*Content:\*\* For each primary page (e.g., home\\\_page\\\_details.md, dashboard\\\_details.md):  

&nbsp;   \* What the page represents and its primary purpose.  

&nbsp;   \* List of main components on the page.  

&nbsp;   \* Key interactions and user flows specific to this page.  

\* \*\*Docs/\\\[page\\\_name\\]/\\\[page\\\_name\\]\\\_animations.md\*\*:  

&nbsp; \* \*\*Content:\*\* Specific animation details for elements on that page, adhering to the jitter animations preference or other defined styles.  

\* \*\*Docs/\\\[page\\\_name\\]/\\\[page\\\_name\\]\\\_story\\\_X.md\*\*:  

&nbsp; \* \*\*Content:\*\* Multiple user stories for each page (e.g., home\\\_page\\\_story\\\_1.md, home\\\_page\\\_story\\\_2.md). Each story will contain granular sub-tasks.  

&nbsp; \* \*\*Agile Task Tracking:\*\* The "Gemini UI/UX Expert Gem" (me) will mark tasks as \\\[x\\] (completed) within these files as they are addressed.



\### \*\*Step 6: Agile Iteration \& Task Completion\*\*



\* \*\*Action:\*\* Work through the \\\_story\\\_X.md files. As tasks are completed (either by you or through AI-generated code/design), inform the AI.  

\* \*\*AI Action:\*\* The AI will update the task status (\\\[ \\] to \\\[x\\]) in the relevant \\\_story\\\_X.md file and assist with the next logical steps or generate necessary assets/code.



\### \*\*Step 7: Git Worktree for Iteration\*\*



\* \*\*Action:\*\* For significant design iterations or feature explorations, utilize Git worktrees.  

&nbsp; \* Create a new worktree for a specific design variant or feature.  

&nbsp; \* git worktree add \\-b \\<branch-name\\> ./trees/\\<branch-name\\>  

&nbsp; \* Work on the design within this isolated environment.  

\* \*\*Benefit:\*\* This allows for parallel experimentation without affecting the main branch, enabling easy comparison and merging of the best solutions.
